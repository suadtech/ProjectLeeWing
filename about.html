            <h4>WORKING JOURNEY</h4>

            <p>

                I am a passionate makeup artist with extensive experience in bridal, editorial, and special effects
                makeup.
                I’ve been working within the makeup industry since 2000 and have had a wealth of experience, so you can
                rest assured you’re in safe hands! Before starting my career in beauty.
                I studied art & design which has provided an invaluable base for makeup artistry.

                Being creative and experimenting with beauty products has always been my vice!.

                I spent my teens making scrap books of beauty looks, influenced by the rise of the 90’s
                supermodel
                juxtaposed with a good amount of grunge! I was the person all my friends would come to
                before a night out!
            </p>

            <h5>MY MAKEUP STYLE…</h5>
            <p>
                As a make up artist my job is to create a look that reflects your individuality and that
                enhances your
                natural and unique beauty. I favour a soft, sepia pallet and love to create naturally
                polished and
                organically beautiful looks; it is important to me that you see and sense the person,
                and not the makeup.
                “I will create a look that captures fresh, modern and understated beauty with you at the
                heart of it.”I feel the real importance that makeup has is the impact in which it can make a person
                feel and the emotive powers it holds in unlocking your confidence.
                This is different for each individual and is why I enjoy so much getting to know each bride I work with
                your personality is an essential component to the look we create.
            </p>

            <h6>HOW IT ALL STARTED…</h6>
            <p>
                My career as a make up artist unfolded by chance 14 years ago when I started what was
                then a temporary
                role at a luxe make up brand. I was finding my feet after leaving university, however
                little did I know this temporary part time job would become a life long career and passion.
                I was soon enamoured by the power of makeup and the many uses it has for each individual;
                to me,make up goes beyond what you’re seeing to supporting how someone is feeling.
                
                “That personal impact you can have on someone through the craft of make up made it my
                calling!”
                While working for make up brands, I was exposed to a wealth of knowledge and many
                creative influences.
                As my roles grew, I was able to experience many elements of the makeup world, from
                private events to
                fashion shows which taught me the skills to complete creative, imaginative makeup looks
                to the everyday.

                An open back dress, muted sepia tones, glowing radiant skin, gold shoes, greenery, fresh
                flowers, dried
                grasses, fluffy brows, a cream blush, bringing the indoors outdoors…rugs and lampshades
                and chandeliers
                under trees, absolutely anything french, live music, festoon lighting.
            </p>

            <h6>…AND THINGS I DON’T</h6>
            In beauty, it is over the top false lashes, metallic high frosted highlighter, hair sprayed
            hair that
            doesn’t move, caked on matte foundation and heavy contour. In life, it is pre-made packet
            sandwiches (I
            just can’t handle the sog), I absolutely cannot cope with coriander and slugs in my garden
            make me angry
            and feel ill at the same time!
