                            <p >I’ve been working
                                within the makeup industry since 2000 and have had a wealth of experience, so you can
                                rest assured
                                you’re in safe hands! Before starting my career in beauty I studied art & design which
                                has provided an
                                invaluable base for makeup artistry.

                                Being creative and experimenting with beauty products has always been my vice!

                                I spent my teens making scrap books of beauty looks, influenced by the rise of the 90’s
                                supermodel
                                juxtaposed with a good amount of grunge! I was the person all my friends would come to
                                before a night
                                out!</p>

                            <h3>MY MAKEUP STYLE…</h3>
                            <p>
                                As a make up artist my job is to create a look that reflects your individuality and that
                                enhances your
                                natural and unique beauty. I favour a soft, sepia pallet and love to create naturally
                                polished and
                                organically beautiful looks; it is important to me that you see and sense the person,
                                and not the make
                                up.

                                “I will create a look that captures fresh, modern and understated beauty with you at the
                                heart of it.”
                                I feel the real importance that makeup has is the impact in which it can make a person
                                feel and the
                                emotive powers it holds in unlocking your confidence. This is different for each
                                individual and is why I
                                enjoy so much getting to know each bride I work with; your personality is an essential
                                component to the
                                look we create.
                            </p>



                            <h4>HOW IT ALL STARTED…</h4>
                            <p>
                                My career as a make up artist unfolded by chance 14 years ago when I started what was
                                then a temporary
                                role at a luxe make up brand. I was finding my feet after leaving university, however
                                little did I know
                                this temporary part time job would become a life long career and passion. I was soon
                                enamoured by the
                                power of makeup and the many uses it has for each individual; to me, make up goes beyond
                                what you’re
                                seeing to supporting how someone is feeling.

                                “That personal impact you can have on someone through the craft of make up made it my
                                calling!”
                                While working for make up brands, I was exposed to a wealth of knowledge and many
                                creative influences.
                                As my roles grew, I was able to experience many elements of the makeup world, from
                                private events to
                                fashion shows which taught me the skills to complete creative, imaginative makeup looks
                                to the everyday.

                                An open back dress, muted sepia tones, glowing radiant skin, gold shoes, greenery, fresh
                                flowers, dried
                                grasses, fluffy brows, a cream blush, bringing the indoors outdoors…rugs and lampshades
                                and chandeliers
                                under trees, absolutely anything french, live music, festoon lighting.
                            </p>

                            <h5>…AND THINGS I DON’T</h5>
                            ﻿In beauty, it is over the top false lashes, metallic high frosted highlighter, hair sprayed
                            hair that
                            doesn’t move, caked on matte foundation and heavy contour. In life, it is pre-made packet
                            sandwiches (I
                            just can’t handle the sog), I absolutely cannot cope with coriander and slugs in my garden
                            make me angry
                            and feel ill at the same time!
                            </p>
